Problem 1) For problem 1 used a series of BASH commands to make a variable containing the number of messages, and the number of directories
			  that contained messages.


Problem 2)For problem 2 I used a similar method as problem 1. I got the necessary lines and cut away the undesirable
			 parts of the string. I then sorted and used 'uniq' to get the number of messages in each thread. I then did a numerical sort
			 based on the results from the uniq. I then used an awk expression to begin at the end of the file and work backwards ensuring
			 all the same length threads are displayed under the length.

Problem 3)For problem 3 I found all of the lines that began with TimeStamp: since in the email that was the header. 
			 I used these lines to match the argument date with the lines containing the argument date and then printed
			 the message number for each message that was sent on that date.

Problem4)For problem 4 I used a similar identification techingue for problem 3 being sure to only site the header 'To:'. 
			I then removed all of the line except for what was after the @ and before the next space. This allowed me 
			to sort case sensitively and then count how many unique results I got.

These files use a combination of BASH commands and awk. All that is needed is the arguments (specified in instructions)
and the ARCHIVE (file location). Some of these files make temp files but they are deleted at the end of each program.
