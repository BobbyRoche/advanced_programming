Q1: Running bug3 caused the error : Segmentation fault (core dumped).
    There is a new file exe called bug3 and a file called core was recently modified

Q2: 2 functions bombed:

	0x00000000004009ad in inTable()
	and
	0x0000000000400920 in main()

Q3: The error in bug3.c was Segmentation fault (core dumped)
 
 This bug was fixed by incrementing numlines after the pointer was returned by strdup(buff); It was trying to read and write to memory that did not exist.

Q4: This is a logic error rather than a syntactic error, thus the compiler does not catch it. To fix this brackets need to be placed under the for
 		loop around all code that wants to be run in the loop.

Q5:
This will cause an error. The string comparison function will not be able to tell the difference between int values.
