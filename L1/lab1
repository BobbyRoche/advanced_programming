Q2: After typing ls -l I can see all of the files/directories in my current directory. My CWD is my Lab01 directory which includes the vi_lab file
as well as my lab01 answersheet. Also included are the 2 files that were requested to be copied for this lab (funny, hello.bash). I can see the permissions
on each of these files as well as the owner, group, size, date, and time of creation.

Q3: In this case, giving executing chmod 644 would allow the owner read and write access. The group and the others have read only access

Q4:The chmod 755 command would give read, write, and execute permission to the owner. The group and others have read an execute permissions. 

Q5: Yes

Q6:Yes

Q7: No

Q8: I can use the command chmod and either use 7 or 5 as the first digit. You can also use chmod u+x to give yourself execute permission.

Q9: The editor gave me an error (E45) and stated I had read only access.

Q10:
	ls *: This displayed all of the files in my directory (non hidden)
	ls a*: This displayed all files that started with 'a'.
	ls *m*: This displayed all files that contain 'm'.
	ls anno?: This displayed the 'annoy' file
	ls annoy?: This yielded no output, I expect to see annoy.cc but I did not. 

Q11: Using a space created two separate files to edit.
